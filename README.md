## Overview and Origin
Plaid is a financial services company based in San Francisco, California. 
The company specializes in building data transfer networks that powers fintech and digital finance products. Plaid’s product, a technology platform, enables applications to connect with user’s bank accounts. It allows consumers and businesses to interact with their bank accounts, check balances, and make payments through different financial technology applications. Currently, the company operates in countries like U.S., Canada, UK, France Spain, Ireland and the Netherlands.
     Plaid was founded in 2013 by Zach Perret and William Hockey. The pair originally tried to build a consumer financial management product, including budgeting and bookkeeping software. Due to challenges, they faced in connecting bank accounts required for these tools, they decided to pivot their core business focus to a unified banking API. 
In late 2013, Plaid raised a $2.8 million seed round from Spark Capital, Google Ventures, and New Enterprises Associates. In 2014, Plaid raised $12.5 million from New Enterprises Associates (One of the World’s largest venture capital firms based in American that focuses on investment stages from seed stage through growth stage across an array of industry sectors).
Plaid builds a data transfer network that powers Fintech and digital finance products. From the consumer side, this means they allow common apps such as Venmo and Chime to offer banking services without having to develop all the infrastructure themselves. For immediate linking of their bank funds, users of the apps are required to share their bank login credentials with Plaid. For some banks, Plaid will not receive user credentials and instead users will authorize access to bank data through their bank's portal. In October 2020, Plaid announced the "all-new Plaid Link" to reduce the steps necessary to connect financial products. The company added an instant payout feature based on the Real Time Payments (RTP) network to the Plaid Transfer product in April 2023. The service lets businesses disburse loan payments, payout insurance or wages in real-time.
December 2018, the company announced a $250 million Series C round with a valuation of $2.65 billion. The funding was led by Mary Meeker, with Andreesen Horowitz and Index Ventures joining as new investors. Former backers Goldman Sachs, NEA and Spark Capital also participated. It was later revealed by Plaid that both Visa and Mastercard had invested in the round. In April of 2021, Plaid raised a $425 million series D at a valuation of $13.4 billion.

## Business Activities
Plaid is committed to making it easy for people to securely connect their financial accounts to the fintech services they choose. Plaid has supports over 12,000 financial institutions so the over 8000 digital financial services built on Plaid can be accessible to everyone.
Plaid works with companies that want to onboard new users, connect user bank accounts, enable ACH payments, get transactions history, underwrite loans, prevent NSF/Overdraft fees, reduce fraud risk, avoid credit card fees creating a path to money happiness.According to 6sense website, Plaid’s current customers are estimated to be 8211, capped at a market share of 81.97%, ranging from industries like Education (loan Originators), Fintech, Technology, Advocacy, Fundraising, Financial services, Marketing, among others. 
 A major advantage of Plaid having a usage-based business model is the potential to grow alongside some of its earliest customers. Specifically, Plaid’s revenue is a function of its API usage. By extension, its revenue is also a function of the number of developers or users using Plaid’s API in some way. As a result, the more users an app or service has, the more API calls that company will send, and the more revenue that Plaid will generate from a specific customer. For example, Plaid’s ability to capture customers such as Venmo and Robinhood early in their rise, coupled with a usage-based business model has allowed Plaid to benefit from the growth of its customers. Here is how a former Plaid employee described Plaid’s early outlook on a usage-based model:

“The way we viewed our self-service product was, it's a way for us to capture as many lottery tickets as cheaply as possible … We don't know which early-stage company is going to get funding, which company has gotten into YC, or which companies are really going to break out and drive a lot of growth. But we do know we want those companies.” 

Additional products are being released, indicative of Plaid’s goal to create a comprehensive account funding solution. Three notable products apart of Plaid’s larger offering are Plaid Portal, Plaid Exchange, and Wallet Onboard. A significant portion of Plaid's recent product updates share a similar theme: data security and privacy. Plaid Portal represents Plaid’s ongoing commitment to establishing transparency with users. Released in January 2022, Plaid Portal is a privacy tool that centralizes all the connections a user has made using Plaid across the entire fintech landscape. More importantly, it gives the user the ability to control which apps can have access to their financial data. Thus, if a user feels inclined to unlink a bank account from a specific app, or even delete information from Plaid’s database, they have the power to do so via Plaid Portal. A second notable tool within Plaid’s larger product offering is Plaid Exchange. Plaid built its reputation on the variety of APIs it offered, all of which were focused on helping developers efficiently access different pieces of financial information for users. With developers taken care of, Plaid’s next frontier was to help financial institutions implement their own APIs. In May 2020, Plaid released Plaid Exchange, which the company described as a way to provide banks with “API connectivity in a box.”
> In October 2022, Plaid launched its first crypto product called Wallet Onboard. With Wallet Onboard, Plaid is bringing its account linking technology to web3. Specifically, the product allows web3 developers to offer integrations with over 300 wallets including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust. Similar to linking a bank account, users can connect their wallet of choice to any Ethereum blockchain-based app. Wallet Onboard marks the start of various Web3 products that Plaid intends on launching.
Plaid uses secure cloud infrastructure technologies to enable quick and safe connection, the combination of AES-256 AND TLS help keep personal information sage end-to-end. Plaid’s API are continuously monitored by their info security team as well as security researchers who seek to regularly audit the API and security controls.

Contrary
Thesis
In recent years, companies are increasingly offering embedded financial products in existing interfaces. Online retailers offer financing at the point of sale (via companies like Afterpay, Klarna, or Affirm), coffee shops or restaurant offer loyalty programs through dedicated apps (Chipotle, Starbucks), and business offer their employees branded corporate cards (Ramp, Brex).

The growing category of integrated financial services in non-financial products is known as embedded finance, and it is quickly expanding in terms of market size. Embedded finance produced $22.5 billion in revenue in 2020, a figure projected to grow 10x by 2025, when it will reach $230 billion in revenue potential. This rapid growth is being driven by changing consumer expectations for frictionless, on-demand financial services, as well as growth in adjacent categories like BNPL, neobanks, and digital payments.

Plaid is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of embedded finance. It has built a widely-used abstraction layer that provides seamless integration between financial applications, banks, and other financial service providers. Acting as an intermediary between the growing field of finance apps (Venmo, Robinhood, Wealthfront, or Coinbase), Plaid functions as an essential connection layer for developers of financial apps to interface with banks on behalf of their end customers.

Founding Story
Plaid co-founders Zach Perret and William Hockey first met as consultants at Bain & Co’s Atlanta office. The two set out to build a consumer-facing financial planning app after experiencing a lack of transparency in the bills they paid. However, the duo would quickly hit a roadblock common across fintech startups: developing custom integrations for each financial institution was a daunting task. Plaid co-founder, William Hockey explains this struggle, stating:

“We started to realize we were struggling so much of the time because we couldn’t connect anything to financial services. The fundamental building blocks that make it really easy to build an application, we just couldn’t find.”

This roadblock sparked the idea to build an API to simplify the process of linking user’s bank accounts to fintech apps. However, this initially received little interest from investors. Running out of options, the co-founders were determined to prove the viability of their idea and entered the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt hackathon in Manhattan. Perret and Hockey built an app called Rambler that mapped out consumers banking activity, and ended up winning the hackathon. Although Rambler is long gone, its underlying technology (now known as Plaid) captured the attention of venture capitalists and fintech developers who struggled with building integrations for different financial institutions.

One of those early fintech adopters was Venmo. Plaid’s relationship with Venmo developed from the head of engineering at Venmo, who happened to be a friend of Perret and Hockey’s, and wanted a more efficient way to connect Venmo to a user’s bank account. At the time, Venmo relied on settling transactions in large batches, which led to delayed payments and additional risk for the peer-to-peer transfer company.

Using Plaid, Venmo was able to more quickly and seamlessly verify and connect to a users’ bank account across many banks. Word of the partnership’s success travelled throughout the fintech world, and applications like Robinhood, Acorns, and Coinbase were quick to become Plaid users. As word of mouth and a strong community of young fintech startups continued to snowball, Plaid became the standard for financial institution infrastructure.

Product

Source: Plaid

Plaid’s core product is Link, an API that sits between a financial institution and an app or service needing to access relevant banking data. Built for developers, companies can build apps on top of the Plaid API without having to devote time and money to figuring out how to integrate with financial institutions. Plaid assumes the weight of the complex integrations, allowing developers to focus on their main goal of building a useful financial application.

Over the past decade, Plaid has diversified its product offering to include a number of APIs intended to perform specific actions in the account linking and financial data retrieval process. As of December 2022, Plaid offered a suite of 10 APIs that enable developers to build a variety of financial products.

Assets
The Assets API allows lenders to easily determine if a borrower has sufficient assets to be approved for a loan. Specifically, a lender can request to obtain an Asset Report from a borrower using the Assets API. To uphold security and user privacy, Plaid keeps the borrower in control of their asset information by allowing them to grant permission for the Asset Report and to revoke access to their data when information is no longer required. This API allows lenders to automate their loan application process and obtain more borrowers.

Auth
The Auth API can instantly authenticate the existence of user’s bank account, allowing payments to be initiated. When a user connects their checking or savings accounts to an application via Plaid Link, the Auth API will fetch the corresponding account and routing number. Once the account is authenticated, ACH payments are enabled, allowing users to move money from their bank account to a specific application, and vice versa.


Source: Plaid

Balance
Where the Auth API verifies that a bank account actually exists for a given set of login credentials, Balance will then verify the amount of funds in the account. Although many of Plaid’s products provide data regarding the balance of an account, the information is updated once a day and cached data is provided. Conversely, the Balance API provides real-time data which can be necessary for a number of applications.

Additionally, the Balance API provides more clarity into available funds versus current funds. As available funds factors in the presence of overdraft considerations. This aspect of the Balance API helps companies reduce the risk of overdraft.

Identity
The Identity API verifies a users identity using personal information associated with their bank account. First, the API makes an Identity Request, and after approval from the user, the Identity API retrieves personal data such as the user’s name, email, phone numbers, and addresses. The Identity API enhances the user experience for the consumer by enabling financial apps to reduce the risk of fraud by verifying user information. Additional layers of verification help in preventing account takeovers, and instances of fraud.

Identity Verification
Not to be confused with the Identity API, Identity Verification was introduced to Plaid’s product suite in May 2018. The API is composed of three verification methods: Authoritative Data Source, Documentary, and Liveness (selfie) Verification.

Authoritative Data Source verification confirms personal information such as name, date of birth, social security numbers, and allows users to autofill their information.

Documentary Verification is capable of verifying 16K types of IDs including passports and driver's licenses through the use of a machine-learning algorithm. The Identity Verification API is capable of confirming the IDs of 200+ countries in under 30 seconds. Despite being launched in May 2022, Identity Verification has already verified over 100 million identities as of October 2022.

Selfie Verification works with Documentary Verification to match a photo of the customers face to the photo provided on their ID.

Income
Only available in the US, the Income API verifies a user’s income and employment with three different methods: Payroll Income, Document Income, and Bank Income.

Payroll Income obtains information from a user’s payroll account. When a user agrees to a payroll request, Plaid can obtain payroll data including deductions, earnings, employer data, pay period frequency, and W2 information. The payroll income user flow is depicted below.


Source: Plaid

Document Income retrieves information from any documents physically uploaded by the user. This method is meant to accommodate user’s who payroll provider is not listed, however, it will extract the same info as the Payroll Income method.

The Bank Income method retrieves information directly from the bank account connected by the user. The Income API will notice recurring deposits from an employer and can extract information such as income category, income frequency, and total amount. The Bank Income method flow is as follows.


Source: Plaid

Investments
The Investments API is responsible for retrieving data related to a user’s investment holdings which can be incorporated into a personal finance or wealth management app. Investments is capable of obtaining both general data related to a specific investment, and general user data based on their holdings. Holding data creates a holistic picture of a user’s investments by retrieving cost basis information, quantity of the security, purchase price, and total book value of the holding.

As is the case with most of Plaid’s products, the more financial institution integrations that the API can facilitate, the more valuable the product becomes. For the Investments API, it offers connections to a broad network consisting of banks, brokerages, crypto exchanges, credit unions, and retirement plan providers. Additionally, the API can pull data from 20 account types, as depicted below.


Source: Plaid

Transactions
The Transactions API performs a similar function to the Investments API. However, it covers a user’s general transactions as opposed to just investments. Data pulled by the Transactions API covers a 24 month period and includes details such as geolocation, merchant, and purchase category. Every transaction linked to a user’s bank account is continuously updated, and notifications are received through the use of a webhook. Common applications for the Transactions API include personal finance management apps where users are provided with a real-time view of their spending habits.

Liabilities
Liabilities ranging from student loans to credit card debt are a major component of any personal financial management app tracking a user’s finances. The Liabilities API enables applications to retrieve a user’s liability data from their financial institution. For each type of liability or loan, Plaid extracts data, including next payment, interest rate, initial loan amount, and loan duration. The Liabilities API provides loan coverage, providing integrations with major student loan services as well as integrations with credit card programs of thousands of financial institutions.

Monitor
Unfortunately, Plaid has encountered several security concerns resulting in a lawsuit settlement in 2022. In an effort to bolster its fraud prevention capabilities, Plaid introduced the Monitor API in May 2022. Monitor works in conjunction with governments to actively scan user activity in order to implement anti-money laundering (AML) rules, and compare them to politically exposed persons lists. Monitor reduces the risk of fraud, and allows companies to onboard legitimate customers all while avoiding time spent on manual reviews. Within a few months of its release, the Monitor API has already screened over 700 million identities against government watchlists as of October 2022.

Additional Plaid Tools
Although the APIs listed above comprise the bulk of Plaid’s offering, additional products are being released, indicative of Plaid’s goal to create a comprehensive account funding solution. Three notable products apart of Plaid’s larger offering are Plaid Portal, Plaid Exchange, and Wallet Onboard.

Plaid Portal

A significant portion of Plaid's recent product updates share a similar theme: data security and privacy. Plaid Portal represents Plaid’s ongoing commitment to establishing transparency with users. Released in January 2022, Plaid Portal is a privacy tool that centralizes all the connections a user has made using Plaid across the entire fintech landscape. More importantly, it gives the user the ability to control which apps can have access to their financial data. Thus, if a user feels inclined to unlink a bank account from a specific app, or even delete information from Plaid’s database, they have the power to do so via Plaid Portal.

Plaid Exchange

A second notable tool within Plaid’s larger product offering is Plaid Exchange. Plaid built its reputation on the variety of APIs it offered, all of which were focused on helping developers efficiently access different pieces of financial information for users. With developers taken care of, Plaid’s next frontier was to help financial institutions implement their own APIs. In May 2020, Plaid released Plaid Exchange, which the company described as a way to provide banks with “API connectivity in a box.”

Banks are built on outdated, legacy IT systems. This causes complications when communicating with some banks and forces Plaid to rely on screen scraping, a method that is conducive to broken integrations if there are any changes made to a bank’s website. Banking executives are aware of the challenges associated with outdated legacy systems, but they are equally aware of the difficulties of implementing an API.

This is where Plaid Exchange comes in. Within a 12-week timeframe, Plaid Exchange can empower financial institutions to implement an API solution, giving rise to more secure and efficient connections. Additionally, Plaid Exchange aims to lessen the digital divide between large and small banks caused by smaller banks not having the same access to resources as larger banks do to create an API. In its release of Plaid Exchange, Plaid described the importance of advancing digital transformation for all sizes of banks by stating:

“We believe APIs are the future of open finance, and we want to make it as easy as possible for all financial institutions to incorporate APIs into their broader digital transformation agendas regardless of budget size and resources.”

Wallet Onboard

As one of the major players in the fintech landscape, it was only a matter of time before Plaid entered the cryptocurrency space. In October 2022, Plaid launched its first crypto product called Wallet Onboard. With Wallet Onboard, Plaid is bringing its account linking technology to web3. Specifically, the product allows web3 developers to offer integrations with over 300 wallets including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust. Similar to linking a bank account, users can connect their wallet of choice to any Ethereum blockchain-based app. Wallet Onboard marks the start of various Web3 products that Plaid intends on launching. Alain Meier, Head of Identity at Plaid, summarizes Plaid’s outlook on crypto as follows:

“More people are delving into crypto each year and it’s becoming more mainstream. We don’t see this trend slowing down, and we want to help all customers, not just those in traditional finance. That’s why we want to build the services that will drive the most impact for everyone, regardless of market conditions. We’re extremely bullish on the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies and digital assets to improve the transparency and efficiency of financial services.”

Market
Customer
The past decade for Plaid has been characterized by rapid scale, product expansions, and growing responsibility as the main piece of infrastructure for the account linking process. During that time, Plaid has experienced significant changes in which customers they target. Plaid has long been viewed as a product made by developers, for developers. Although partially true, developers are no longer fully representative of Plaid’s entire customer base, which now incorporates financial institutions and end-users in addition to developers. As COO Eric Sager puts it, you can think of Plaid as being at the center of a “three-sided ecosystem that has consumers, developers, and then the institutions.”

Developers

Before founding Plaid, Zach Perret and William Hockey understood firsthand the difficulty fintech developers faced when the duo set out to build their own consumer-facing financial planning app. This experience helped Plaid identify its first segment of customers to target: developers of smaller fintech applications.

As Plaid continued to scale and build a reputation in the fintech space, the company approached large enterprises, but still kept its focus on the developer as the main customer. Plaid uses a bottom-up strategy of “selling through the basement” which entails identifying low-level developers and creating the best possible experience for that individual, who will then advocate for the organization to adopt Plaid. Zach Perret, CEO of Plaid, described Plaid’s strategic emphasis on building for the developer from the bottom up, stating that:

“We’re trying to identify the lowest level engineer, build a fantastic experience for them… Someone’s able to quickly build something in our sandbox. They’re able to quickly launch an application… They do it for free. And then the great thing is, over time, when their boss asks a question or if someone says, “Hey, how do I do that thing over there?” And then the developer saying, “Well, try this. Have you used Plaid?”

This bottom-up strategy has been successful for Plaid, allowing them to win over developers at some of the largest fintech apps in the industry including Venmo, Coinbase, and Robinhood. Below is a sample of high-profile Plaid clients that fall in this category.

Financial Institutions

Plaid continues to expand its product offering into different segments of the account-linking process. Given the nature of Plaid’s core product, its relationship with financial institutions has been evolving since the company’s inception. With the launch of Plaid Exchange in 2020, financial institutions became a primary customer group for Plaid. Eric Sager, COO at Plaid, described Plaid’s customer relationship with financial institutions as follows:

“I think our partnerships with [financial] institutions have been evolving over the life of Plaid. Obviously, very recently, you’ve seen a lot of the data access agreements we’ve signed with the vast majority of large institutions in the US… Many of the institutions now are also customers. [Financial institutions] are both developers / customers, as we call them, and housing a lot of the data that consumers want to access.”

Furthermore, Sager highlights the immediate benefits that financial institutions get from becoming one of Plaid’s customers under Plaid Exchange, stating that:

“By integrating into Plaid, [financial Institutions] get insight into what’s happening at other institutions, but even more crucially now, they’re also getting insight into what’s happening in a lot of the fintechs. If I’m a large bank and have a large wealth advisory, it’s increasingly difficult for my wealth advisers to be credible if they don’t have insight into what a client is doing at Coinbase, Robinhood, Weibo, or any of the other fintechs that are now increasingly playing in that space. So, as [financial Institutions] see the benefits of that ecosystem and of that approach, they’re much more likely to want to share as well. The second piece is that the large [financial] institutions have the brand, the customers, and in many cases, the DDA [demand deposit accounts] that are still at the heart of this. By permissioning and by participating in the ecosystem in a more proactive way, they solidify their core accounts’ position in it.”

End Users

Plaid’s relationship with the end user has always been more indirect than direct. While the end-user interacts with Plaid Link when inputting their bank account login information within an app, Plaid’s original intention was always to provide an outstanding developer experience. In fact, many end users were not even aware of Plaid’s existence. However, recent developments have altered the Plaid end user dynamic, carving out a new customer segment for Plaid to serve.

So, what led to the end-user becoming a major component in Plaid’s customer mix? The answer has to do with Plaid’s recent commitment to become more transparent, trusted, and secure. Sparked by a class action lawsuit filed throughout 2020 and 2021, Plaid began to rethink its security and privacy policies. As the end user is the main concern regarding data privacy, Plaid quickly found themselves launching products that served the end user directly rather than indirectly. COO Eric Sager described how data privacy has propelled the end-user into Plaid’s customer ecosystem in stating that:

“Our fundamental belief at the end of the day is that it’s the consumer’s data, so the consumer should have the choice to share that data for the use cases they want to pursue, as opposed to it being the bank’s data. It ultimately has to be in the best interest of the consumer.”

Plaid launched Plaid Portal in January 2022 to provide end users with a detailed snapshot of all the connections they have made via Plaid. By giving an individual control over where their data can and cannot be shared, Plaid is hoping to enhance transparency and build greater trust to mitigate data privacy concerns.

Market Size
The emergence of financial technology and its widespread adoption among banking consumers has led to the acceleration of the open finance opportunity. As the global open finance market is projected to grow from $15 billion in 2021 to $48 billion in 2026, financial institutions have began to adopt open finance solutions to better manage the data connectivity demanded by their customers. In 2020, it was estimated that only 1 in 5 banks had implemented APIs to manage data connectivity. In response, Plaid released Plaid Exchange to capitalize on a growing willingness on the part of banks to deploy their own API solutions. As Plaid Exchange is one of Plaid’s newer solutions, it has significantly broadened the company’s potential market to include financial institutions looking to jump on the open finance train.

While the traditional finance landscape has fueled much of Plaid’s growth over the past decade, Plaid’s market opportunity becomes further amplified as more applications want to integrate directly with consumer bank accounts, even if their core use case isn’t financial. Known as embedded finance, it enables every company to be a fintech company. As depicted below, the embedded finance ecosystem flows from financial institutions to non-financial companies, flowing through Plaid and third party embedded finance providers.


Source: Plaid

Embedded finance providers such as Unit work with their customers (non-financial companies) to quickly develop partnerships with banks and create APIs to help non-financial companies add financial services such as payment cards. Third-party embedded finance providers then use Plaid’s services to gain access to financial data to get insights into balances and transactions. According to a joint Plaid and Accenture report on embedded finance:

“Embedded financial services will produce $230B in revenues in 2025—a 10-fold increase over the $22.5B in revenues in 2020.”

In summary, Plaid continues to diversify its services, including Plaid’s role in a rapidly growing embedded finance market, and the introduction of Plaid Exchange to support financial institutions API implementation. In doing so, the company’s market opportunity continues to expand as Plaid is entering different niches across the finance landscape.

Competition
As the concept of open banking continues to rapidly spread throughout financial institutions, Plaid is certainly not alone in its attempt to own the account linking process. Most of Plaid’s competition is located in Europe, where open banking is emerging, particularly in the United Kingdom.

One company at the forefront of open banking in Europe is Tink. Tink offers a similar product suite to Plaid including Income Check, Transactions data, and Risk Insights. In terms of scale, Tink is much smaller than Plaid, connecting to 3.4K financial institutions and serving 300 companies, compared to Plaid’s 12K integrations and 6K customers. In 2021, Tink was acquired by Visa just 5 months after Visa’s attempt to acquire Plaid was cancelled due to regulatory concerns. The deal was able to pass given the greater competitive landscape in the European open banking space compared to the U.S.

Within the U.S., Plaid’s largest pure-play competitor is MX Technologies. Like Plaid, MX’s goal is to unlock the value of financial data through the use of APIs. MX offers open finance APIs including account aggregation, transactions information, money management, and account verification. MX operates on a smaller scale than Plaid, powering ~2K financial institutions and fintechs.

In recent years, Plaid’s consistent product expansions have allowed Plaid to enter new markets, thus facing new competition. Each new category has its own set of competitors. For example, identity verification puts Plaid in competition with Persona, Alloy, Veriff, Socure, and Stripe Identity. Another example is Signal, a tool that analyzes the risks of pending bank transfers, giving companies insight into potential fraudulent activities. Plaid’s Head of Identity, Alain Meier, believes that Signal will bring Plaid into direct competition with other fraud-rating tools including Orum and Sardine.

Business Model
Plaid operates under a freemium usage-based model, meaning that its core set of products can be tested for free with the possibility to upgrade to a paid plan with greater capabilities.
Plaid has three main pricing models that govern its products: One-Time Fees, Per Request Fees, and Subscription Fees.
* One-time fees are associated with one-time tasks. For Plaid, this pricing model governs products such as Auth, which authorizes a user’s account and verifies their identity and is typically a one-time occurrence.
* Per Request fees are incurred for each successful API call (request) to a product endpoint asking to provide a specific service or piece of information. This type of fee governs Plaid’s products and services such as Asset Reports and Balance checks.
* Subscriptions fees entail items that occur repeatedly and will incur a monthly fee as long as the item exists. For instance, Plaid’s Transactions product allows a company to check a user’s transactions, an action that is charges on a per connection, per month basis.

## Landscape

Plaid is in the Embedded Finance Domain. This phenomenon is enabled by third-party ‘banking-as-a-service’ companies that use API integrations to embed financial services into the user experience of non-financial companies.
Embedded finance can improve the customer experience and unlock a huge market opportunity for businesses, and is projected to rise dramatically in the coming years. It’s estimated that embedded financial services will produce $384.8B in revenue by 2029—a nearly 17x increase over the $22.5B in revenue generated in 2020. Embedded fintech provides a way for financial institutions to offer a wider range of services, engage their customers, and deliver more value. Historically, if a bank wanted to offer a new product, say a new type of investment or a different type of loan, they would need to spend months, if not years, developing, building, and launching a new product. With the rise of embedded fintech, they can embed these offerings in their current products. This lowers the economic risks and allows traditionally slow-moving banking companies to become more nimble and adjust to changing customer needs. [Plaid website] 

Some embedded financial services have been around for a while, like airline credit cards, car rental insurance, and payment plans for high-priced items. Now embedded finance is taking hold online, as e-commerce retailers are offering banking services directly on their websites without re-directing customers to a bank.By opening up new markets and improving customer experiences, embedded finance presents a significant opportunity to both financial service providers and non-financial companies in multiple industries. the Major trends and innovations of this domain with a picturesque view

> Plaid faces stiff competition from a fellow disruptor company Stripe; which recently announced a new product called Financial Connections which will allow customers a way to connect directly to their customer’s bank accounts, providing access to financial data to sped up certain transactions. 
Other competitors include,  Galileo Financial technologies, Akoya, Finicity, Synapse, Codat
## Results
Without Plaid, being a third party, whose technology links bank accounts to fintech apps like Robinhood, Coinbase, Venmo, start-ups would have had to hire their own engineers and create their own ways to sync with banks. For companies, Plaid offers a simple yet secure way to connect with customer’s financial data. Their API gives businesses the opportunity to easily access, manage and use the financial data of their customers allowing for a more congruent, effective and personalized experience. For Developers, it simplifies the process of working with financial data which allows them to build financial software and for consumers, Plaid offers a secure way to manage their finances, and security measures to protect user’s data.
## Controversies
* The company has faced controversy for scraping user data, impersonating bank login screens, and not properly disclosing the privacy risks associated with the service. TD Bank filed a lawsuit against Plaid in 2020 accusing the company of trying to "dupe" its users.
* In 2021, Plaid settled a $58 million class action lawsuit over claims that it passed on personal banking data to third party firms without user consent. The settlement encompasses five separate lawsuits combined as one. Each claim that Plaid used consumers’ banking login credentials to gather and distribute detailed financial data without prior consent.
* Plaid has "exploited its position as middleman," the plaintiffs alleged. Approximately 98 million people are affected by the settlement. Claimants will be given the option to receive the settlement money automatically through payment platforms such as PayPal and Venmo.

## Recommendations

### Opportunities for Plaid
Plaid’s products have always relied on network effects. As Plaid incorporates more integrations across more products and types of financial data, that network effect will only expand. Plaid’s layer of abstraction is a valuable asset that has allowed them to expand into adjacent areas of financial services in recent years including turning credit card history and account transfers into a loan decision to assist mortgage companies.
The long-term thesis for Plaid revolves around the opportunity to reach non-fintech applications and companies. Plaid can broaden the scope to include any company that could benefit from integrating with a customer’s bank account. Plaid could help apps in sectors such as hospitality, travel, and shopping to better understand consumers’ spending and offer them personalized deals. Plaid CTO, Jean-Denis Greze spoke to the potential of reaching non-fintech companies in stating that:
“Our philosophy is to provide the building blocks, and then we’re often surprised by how developers can use those building blocks to do something clever. We don’t know what that will look like. But we know that we make it easier for consumers to get started, make it easier for developers to build products full of insights, and we make it easier even for non-fintechs to start to offer things like payments or loans.“
I believe that this service will exponentially increase the market share of Plaid thereby increasing their revenue. Being the first to step into this before its competitors do pave a way for securing Higher growth in revenue before its competitors step into this phase and potentially becoming the backbone of the open marking domain capturing both financial and non financial institutions.
 Plaid would use the same technologies if they decide to venture into the non-financial sector although the API would be different to suit the particular non-financial sector. For instance, in a real estate, they can have a VR API which will allow virtual walk through the house they are interested in purchasing
This will easily help pave the way for Plaid to contribute to non financial institutions thereby maximize their revenues.
