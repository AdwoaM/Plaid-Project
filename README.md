## Overview and Origin
Plaid is a financial services company based in San Francisco, California. 
The company specializes in building data transfer networks that powers fintech and digital finance products. Plaid’s product, a technology platform, enables applications to connect with user’s bank accounts. It allows consumers and businesses to interact with their bank accounts, check balances, and make payments through different financial technology applications. Currently, the company operates in countries like U.S., Canada, UK, France Spain, Ireland and the Netherlands.
     Plaid was founded in 2013 by Zach Perret and William Hockey. The pair originally tried to build a consumer financial management product, including budgeting and bookkeeping software. Due to challenges, they faced in connecting bank accounts required for these tools, they decided to pivot their core business focus to a unified banking API. 
In late 2013, Plaid raised a $2.8 million seed round from Spark Capital, Google Ventures, and New Enterprises Associates. In 2014, Plaid raised $12.5 million from New Enterprises Associates (One of the World’s largest venture capital firms based in American that focuses on investment stages from seed stage through growth stage across an array of industry sectors).
Plaid builds a data transfer network that powers Fintech and digital finance products. From the consumer side, this means they allow common apps such as Venmo and Chime to offer banking services without having to develop all the infrastructure themselves. For immediate linking of their bank funds, users of the apps are required to share their bank login credentials with Plaid. For some banks, Plaid will not receive user credentials and instead users will authorize access to bank data through their bank's portal. In October 2020, Plaid announced the "all-new Plaid Link" to reduce the steps necessary to connect financial products. The company added an instant payout feature based on the Real Time Payments (RTP) network to the Plaid Transfer product in April 2023. The service lets businesses disburse loan payments, payout insurance or wages in real-time.
December 2018, the company announced a $250 million Series C round with a valuation of $2.65 billion. The funding was led by Mary Meeker, with Andreesen Horowitz and Index Ventures joining as new investors. Former backers Goldman Sachs, NEA and Spark Capital also participated. It was later revealed by Plaid that both Visa and Mastercard had invested in the round. In April of 2021, Plaid raised a $425 million series D at a valuation of $13.4 billion.

## Business Activities
Plaid is committed to making it easy for people to securely connect their financial accounts to the fintech services they choose. Plaid has supports over 12,000 financial institutions so the over 8000 digital financial services built on Plaid can be accessible to everyone.
Plaid works with companies that want to onboard new users, connect user bank accounts, enable ACH payments, get transactions history, underwrite loans, prevent NSF/Overdraft fees, reduce fraud risk, avoid credit card fees creating a path to money happiness.According to 6sense website, Plaid’s current customers are estimated to be 8211, capped at a market share of 81.97%, ranging from industries like Education (loan Originators), Fintech, Technology, Advocacy, Fundraising, Financial services, Marketing, among others. 
 A major advantage of Plaid having a usage-based business model is the potential to grow alongside some of its earliest customers. Specifically, Plaid’s revenue is a function of its API usage. By extension, its revenue is also a function of the number of developers or users using Plaid’s API in some way. As a result, the more users an app or service has, the more API calls that company will send, and the more revenue that Plaid will generate from a specific customer. For example, Plaid’s ability to capture customers such as Venmo and Robinhood early in their rise, coupled with a usage-based business model has allowed Plaid to benefit from the growth of its customers. Here is how a former Plaid employee described Plaid’s early outlook on a usage-based model:

“The way we viewed our self-service product was, it's a way for us to capture as many lottery tickets as cheaply as possible … We don't know which early-stage company is going to get funding, which company has gotten into YC, or which companies are really going to break out and drive a lot of growth. But we do know we want those companies.” 

Additional products are being released, indicative of Plaid’s goal to create a comprehensive account funding solution. Three notable products apart of Plaid’s larger offering are Plaid Portal, Plaid Exchange, and Wallet Onboard. A significant portion of Plaid's recent product updates share a similar theme: data security and privacy. Plaid Portal represents Plaid’s ongoing commitment to establishing transparency with users. Released in January 2022, Plaid Portal is a privacy tool that centralizes all the connections a user has made using Plaid across the entire fintech landscape. More importantly, it gives the user the ability to control which apps can have access to their financial data. Thus, if a user feels inclined to unlink a bank account from a specific app, or even delete information from Plaid’s database, they have the power to do so via Plaid Portal. A second notable tool within Plaid’s larger product offering is Plaid Exchange. Plaid built its reputation on the variety of APIs it offered, all of which were focused on helping developers efficiently access different pieces of financial information for users. With developers taken care of, Plaid’s next frontier was to help financial institutions implement their own APIs. In May 2020, Plaid released Plaid Exchange, which the company described as a way to provide banks with “API connectivity in a box.”
> In October 2022, Plaid launched its first crypto product called Wallet Onboard. With Wallet Onboard, Plaid is bringing its account linking technology to web3. Specifically, the product allows web3 developers to offer integrations with over 300 wallets including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust. Similar to linking a bank account, users can connect their wallet of choice to any Ethereum blockchain-based app. Wallet Onboard marks the start of various Web3 products that Plaid intends on launching.
Plaid uses secure cloud infrastructure technologies to enable quick and safe connection, the combination of AES-256 AND TLS help keep personal information sage end-to-end. Plaid’s API are continuously monitored by their info security team as well as security researchers who seek to regularly audit the API and security controls.

## Business Model
Plaid operates under a freemium usage-based model, meaning that its core set of products can be tested for free with the possibility to upgrade to a paid plan with greater capabilities.
Plaid has three main pricing models that govern its products: One-Time Fees, Per Request Fees, and Subscription Fees.
* One-time fees are associated with one-time tasks. For Plaid, this pricing model governs products such as Auth, which authorizes a user’s account and verifies their identity and is typically a one-time occurrence.
* Per Request fees are incurred for each successful API call (request) to a product endpoint asking to provide a specific service or piece of information. This type of fee governs Plaid’s products and services such as Asset Reports and Balance checks.
* Subscriptions fees entail items that occur repeatedly and will incur a monthly fee as long as the item exists. For instance, Plaid’s Transactions product allows a company to check a user’s transactions, an action that is charges on a per connection, per month basis.

## Landscape

Plaid is in the Embedded Finance Domain. This phenomenon is enabled by third-party ‘banking-as-a-service’ companies that use API integrations to embed financial services into the user experience of non-financial companies.
Embedded finance can improve the customer experience and unlock a huge market opportunity for businesses, and is projected to rise dramatically in the coming years. It’s estimated that embedded financial services will produce $384.8B in revenue by 2029—a nearly 17x increase over the $22.5B in revenue generated in 2020. Embedded fintech provides a way for financial institutions to offer a wider range of services, engage their customers, and deliver more value. Historically, if a bank wanted to offer a new product, say a new type of investment or a different type of loan, they would need to spend months, if not years, developing, building, and launching a new product. With the rise of embedded fintech, they can embed these offerings in their current products. This lowers the economic risks and allows traditionally slow-moving banking companies to become more nimble and adjust to changing customer needs. [Plaid website] 

Some embedded financial services have been around for a while, like airline credit cards, car rental insurance, and payment plans for high-priced items. Now embedded finance is taking hold online, as e-commerce retailers are offering banking services directly on their websites without re-directing customers to a bank.By opening up new markets and improving customer experiences, embedded finance presents a significant opportunity to both financial service providers and non-financial companies in multiple industries. the Major trends and innovations of this domain with a picturesque view

> Plaid faces stiff competition from a fellow disruptor company Stripe; which recently announced a new product called Financial Connections which will allow customers a way to connect directly to their customer’s bank accounts, providing access to financial data to sped up certain transactions. 
Other competitors include,  Galileo Financial technologies, Akoya, Finicity, Synapse, Codat
## Results
Without Plaid, being a third party, whose technology links bank accounts to fintech apps like Robinhood, Coinbase, Venmo, start-ups would have had to hire their own engineers and create their own ways to sync with banks. For companies, Plaid offers a simple yet secure way to connect with customer’s financial data. Their API gives businesses the opportunity to easily access, manage and use the financial data of their customers allowing for a more congruent, effective and personalized experience. For Developers, it simplifies the process of working with financial data which allows them to build financial software and for consumers, Plaid offers a secure way to manage their finances, and security measures to protect user’s data.
## Controversies
* The company has faced controversy for scraping user data, impersonating bank login screens, and not properly disclosing the privacy risks associated with the service. TD Bank filed a lawsuit against Plaid in 2020 accusing the company of trying to "dupe" its users.
* In 2021, Plaid settled a $58 million class action lawsuit over claims that it passed on personal banking data to third party firms without user consent. The settlement encompasses five separate lawsuits combined as one. Each claim that Plaid used consumers’ banking login credentials to gather and distribute detailed financial data without prior consent.
* Plaid has "exploited its position as middleman," the plaintiffs alleged. Approximately 98 million people are affected by the settlement. Claimants will be given the option to receive the settlement money automatically through payment platforms such as PayPal and Venmo.

## Recommendations

### Opportunities for Plaid
Plaid’s products have always relied on network effects. As Plaid incorporates more integrations across more products and types of financial data, that network effect will only expand. Plaid’s layer of abstraction is a valuable asset that has allowed them to expand into adjacent areas of financial services in recent years including turning credit card history and account transfers into a loan decision to assist mortgage companies.
The long-term thesis for Plaid revolves around the opportunity to reach non-fintech applications and companies. Plaid can broaden the scope to include any company that could benefit from integrating with a customer’s bank account. Plaid could help apps in sectors such as hospitality, travel, and shopping to better understand consumers’ spending and offer them personalized deals. Plaid CTO, Jean-Denis Greze spoke to the potential of reaching non-fintech companies in stating that:
“Our philosophy is to provide the building blocks, and then we’re often surprised by how developers can use those building blocks to do something clever. We don’t know what that will look like. But we know that we make it easier for consumers to get started, make it easier for developers to build products full of insights, and we make it easier even for non-fintechs to start to offer things like payments or loans.“
I believe that this service will exponentially increase the market share of Plaid thereby increasing their revenue. Being the first to step into this before its competitors do pave a way for securing Higher growth in revenue before its competitors step into this phase and potentially becoming the backbone of the open marking domain capturing both financial and non financial institutions.
 Plaid would use the same technologies if they decide to venture into the non-financial sector although the API would be different to suit the particular non-financial sector. For instance, in a real estate, they can have a VR API which will allow virtual walk through the house they are interested in purchasing
This will easily help pave the way for Plaid to contribute to non financial institutions thereby maximize their revenues.
